# XAI Method Finder

The XAI Method Finder is a tool that helps to find a suitable XAI Method for a specific use case. It is a guided process that is based on insights from human-centered XAI research. The process is also interactive and easy to understand as users only need to follow the instructions and click the applicable button. The recommendation is based on the following information that is requested by the user:

- Target group
- Background knowledge of the target group
- Explanatory goal
- Type of training data (Images, Text, Tabular Data)
- Problem type (Regression, Classification, Generation)
- Model type (CNN, Transformer, Multi-Layer Perceptron)

Furthermore, the recommendation is based on the selection of three question types:

- Global explanation
- Local explanation
- Counterfactual explanation

The backend consists of an XAI database consisting of state-of-the-art XAI methods and predefined design guidelines with which the explanation can be adapted to the specific target group combination.
